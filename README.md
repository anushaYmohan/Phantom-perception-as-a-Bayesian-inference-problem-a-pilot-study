Dear coders,


This is the source code for processing the data for the Journal of Neurophysiology mansuscript titled "Phantom perception as a Bayesian Inference Problem - a pilot study"
The codes are organised at two levels - preparing the data and data analysis. 
Each of these codes are organised for baseline and no baseline correction analysis for TCD and non-TCD data (auditory, visual). The TCD data is only healthy adults and auditory and visual is for both controls and tinnitus patients. 
In these subfolders you will also see the data analysis for comparing ERP for hits, False alarms and correct rejections for high perceivers and low perceivers as explained in the main paper. 
Please note that further notes are present in the code. 

In case of any query please email me at anusha.mohan@gbhi.org. 

Good luck!

Best regards,
Anusha
