Dear coders
This is the source code for processing the data for the Journal of Neurophysiology mansuscript titled "Phantom perception as a Bayesian Inference Problem - a pilot study"
The codes are organised at two levels - preparing the data and data analysis. 
Each of these codes are organised for TCD and non-TCD data (auditory, visual). The TCD data is only healthy adults and auditory and visual is for both controls and tinnitus patients. 
Please note that further notes are present in the code. 

In case of any query please email me at anusha.mohan@gbhi.org. 

Good luck!

Best regards,
Anusha
